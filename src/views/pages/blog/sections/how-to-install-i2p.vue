    <p>To use I2P to access the dark web, you will need to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download and install the I2P software on your computer. You can find the latest version of I2P at     <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/download/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download I2P</a></li>
      <li>Once the software is installed, launch the I2P router. This will create a secure connection to the I2P network.</li>
      <li> Next, you will need to find the address of a website that is hosted on the I2P network. These addresses typically end in ".i2p" and can be found on various forums and websites that discuss the dark web.</li>
      <li>
        To access a website on the I2P network, you will need to enter the address into a special web browser that is designed to work with I2P. The I2P software comes with its own web browser called "I2P Browser", which you can use for this purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have entered the address of the website you want to visit, the I2P Browser will connect to the I2P network and load the website for you.
      </li>
    </ol>
